.main {
  height: 50vh; //fallback option, serves in the case a certain
  //   browser doesnt support the next line with THE CALCULATION in the height

  /*
IMPORTANT!!

he explained that in this section and device "mobile"
you have to be careful when adding a vh , because in some mobiles you have 
the bar on the top and bottom where you find the browser functionalities such as
: where you search for the  URL of another website for example, i will add the
screenshot he provided, check the READ ME file.

so to solve that issue you have to use a calculation  to capture the inner height
of the window so to adapt those 50vh depending of the size of the window

*/
  height: calc(var(--vh, 1vh) * 50);
//   --vh is the variable you will use in the App.js as you have to set it up also there

  .row {
    h2 {
      .line {
        span {
        }
      }
    }
    // ---
    .btn-row {
      a {
        svg {
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
